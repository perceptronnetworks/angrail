    <p>ANGRAIL aims is to create a global standard research lab for Universities, Colleges and Institutions across the world. Our Research Lab facilities are spread across trending areas such as Robotics, IoT, AI & ML, Cyber security, AR & VR, Hardware & Networking, Cloud Computing, Renewable Energy, etc. We have an experienced team belongs to Engineering, Science, Arts, Education, Management, Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Medical and Allied Health Sciences.</p>

    <p>ANGRAIL offer labs in three modes, namely, Virtual Lab, Remote Lab and Hybrid Labs. Virtual Labs will have the essential trending software tools. A remote lab is a remotely operated physical lab, where the physical equipment shall be accessed anywhere in the world over the internet at any time. Our Hybrid labs is a combination of Virtual and Remote labs. Students will learn the essential software and access the physical equipment to learn the skills. Any school, college and PhD student shall access the lab any time.</p>

    <p>The school Labs are designed for improving Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathemmatics (STEAM) Education and Creativity skills among students. Our carefully designed special project activities will complement the lab activities. Our labs motivate multi-disciplinary participation to enhance the motivation among students. The whole lab shall be accessed online at the ease of the home, and offline mode is also available. </p>

    <p>Our Lab facilities offer comprehensive research facilities to the UG, PG and PhD students. Students will have bridge lab sessions using our school labs before entering into college-level labs. Our college-level virtual labs will have essential software tools like Python, Java, C, Scilab, Blender, R, and so on. The Remote Labs have world-class equipment from IoT, Robotics, Cyber Security and so on. </p>
