    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

                  <p>Internet is the cutting-edge technology bringing the world in the access of hands. Nowadays things like, home appliances, cars, motorcycles, machines are exposing their data into cloud and they are connecting each other. This next generation connecting technology is referred as Internet of Things, shortly called as IoT. IoT has multi fold verticals such as, embedded systems, microcontroller, sensor, actuator, data engineering, cloud computing, app development and diagnostics. Skills needed for IoT is the top skill demanded by the industries.</p>
                  <p>By considering the importance of this technology, we at ANGRAIL had a vision to become a Research hub of IoT. Our IoT lab has hardware and software after prudent brainstorming with the pool of experts. Our labs have both Virtual and Remote labs, which shall be accessed by the students through online and offline mode.</p>

            <p>Faculty and mentors are the backbones for the students and research scholars. We feel it is our duty and responsibility to train and build a foundation for faculty and mentors. There are multiple ways and methods available today for enhancing the skills of faculty.  The Faculty Development Program (FDP) is one among the same, and it has been considered a stand-alone educational pedagogy in fostering knowledge and professional skills. There exist a lot of faculty development programs offered by colleges, universities and independent organizations. Still, there is a vast demand for focused development programs with demanded outcomes. Our FDP has unique pedagogy. It is an interactive way of learning with hands-on exercises, take-home fun problems & assignments and finally a real-world problem-solving.</p> 
            <p>By attending this FDP, we want the faculty/researcher/industry professional to gain complete knowledge and skills on the particular topic.</p>

Our workshop model is unique, and it always has inter-disciplinary department students' involvement. For example, in our IoT workshop, students from Computer Science, Electronics & Communications and any other core engineering & science group students can participate. Theory concepts and the complimenting hands-on exercise will feed your mind and organs to remember the core concepts of the particular topic. At the end of every section, the participants will give a gamified quiz/assignment during the workshop. Finally, a real-world capstone project will be given to the participants to test the outcome of the workshop.</p>
