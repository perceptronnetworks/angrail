      <p>Children's skills are always like a seed. We will never know what will start to germinate from them until it comes out. Projects are one such activity in schools that will manifest the unique skill of the student. We wanted to encourage learning by doing culture among the students to equip themselves for the next generation technological needs.</p>

      <p>We see the world is becoming more connected because of the internet evolution. We want to use this opportunity and introduce a global standard for managing and supporting the projects in schools. </p>

    <h6>Science Project</h6>
    <p>We deal with all types of arts, science, engineering and technology projects involving electronic, electrical, renewable energy, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, plastics, robotics, glass, clay, painting, etc. Every student will get one individual mentor throughout the project work. We teach the skills needed, supply all required hardware and manual for operating the hardware also with students. Upon completion of the projects, students can publish the works in blogs and social media pages.  Our science projects enable any student in the world to connect with any other students.  Students from 3rd grade shall participate in this project. </p>

    <h6>Mathematics Projects</h6>
    <p>Our mathematics projects involve both hardware and software elements. We carefully designed the projects for enriching the mathematical application-oriented learning among student communities. Our pool of experts across the globe will offer the state of the art project experience to students. Our project topics involve exciting applications, such as the application of matrix, differentiation, integration, vectors, complex numbers, numerical methods, statistics, probability, etc. We have mathematics projects from elementary to higher secondary students. </p>

    <h6>Thermocol Projects</h6>
    <p>Thermocol projects will be used for building the structures, elements and other prototypes of any mathematics, arts, craft and science project. Most of the time thermocol projects shall be a compliment for arts, science and mathematics. We have thermocol projects from elementary to higher secondary students. </p>

    <h6>Cut Out Models</h6>
    <p>Cut out models is the activity that will enable the school kids to apply their creativity. As we know, the cognitive skills of a kid will be entirely different for kids, and the cutout model is the starting point for manifesting the kid's talent. Out creative and straightforward to do cut out models will be exciting and fun. </p>
