      <p>Children's skills are always like a seed. We will never know what will start to germinate from them until it comes out. Projects are one such activity in schools that will manifest the unique skill of the student. We wanted to encourage learning by doing culture among the students to equip themselves for the next generation technological needs.</p>

      <p>We see the world is becoming more connected because of the internet evolution. We want to use this opportunity and introduce a global standard for managing and supporting the projects in schools. </p>

    <h6>Science Project</h6>
    <p>We deal with all types of arts, science, engineering and technology projects involving electronic, electrical, renewable energy, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, plastics, robotics, glass, clay, painting, etc. Every student will get one individual mentor throughout the project work. We teach the skills needed, supply all required hardware and manual for operating the hardware also with students. Upon completion of the projects, students can publish the works in blogs and social media pages.  Our science projects enable any student in the world to connect with any other students.  Students from 3rd grade shall participate in this project. </p>
