    <p>Faculty and mentors are the backbones for the students and research scholars. We feel it is our duty and responsibility to train and build a foundation for faculty and mentors. There are multiple ways and methods available today for enhancing the skills of faculty.  The Faculty Development Program (FDP) is one among the same, and it has been considered a stand-alone educational pedagogy in fostering knowledge and professional skills. There exist a lot of faculty development programs offered by colleges, universities and independent organizations. Still, there is a vast demand for focused development programs with demanded outcomes. Our FDP has unique pedagogy. It is an interactive way of learning with hands-on exercises, take-home fun problems & assignments and finally a real-world problem-solving.</p> 
    
    <p>By attending this FDP, we want the faculty/researcher/industry professional to gain complete knowledge and skills on the particular topic.</p>
