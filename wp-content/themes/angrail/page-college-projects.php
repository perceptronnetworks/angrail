There requires a great effort to eliminate the high attrition in the field of PhD. We believe PhD is a prestigious academic achievement for any individual. We want to hand-hold the candidates throughout their PhD journey. However, we want to ensure the candidate attains the highest philosophical knowledge on their selected topic. We support all the courses across all domains in Engineering, Science, Arts, Management, Education, Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Medical and Allied Health Sciences.</p>

The candidate shall split out their work and make it available for our mentors, interns and the learning community. Our mentors will understand the candidates work and share the work with the interns and learning community. Interns shall be first, second or third year UG students, and our learning community will have a versatile set of students. These young kids will pursue the shared problem under the mentor's guidance and share the findings with the PhD candidate.</p>

<p>Our online platform manages all the aspects of the PhD work comprehensively. PhD candidates shall discuss with the mentors and interns, and there can be a cross-learning.</p>
