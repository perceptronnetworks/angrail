                <p>The STEAM Programme aims to increase access to high-quality learning experiences. It is project and problem based learning through hands-on experiences, which help students to see themselves as critical thinkers and problem solvers. Student creates, design, and build to solve problems. The technologically advanced program is designed to better equip our students for tomorrow's challenges.</p>

                <p>STEAM programme curriculum is based on the idea of educating students in five specific disciplines - science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics - in an interdisciplinary and applied approach. Rather than teach the five disciplines as separate and discrete subjects, STEAM integrates them into a cohesive learning paradigm based on real-world applications.</p>

                <p>In STEAM programme the traditional arts, science and math education has been replaced by blended learning environment and showing students how the scientific method can be applied to everyday life. It teaches students computational thinking and focuses on the real world applications of problem solving. STEAM education begins early when students are very young.</p>

                <p>In the modern education system, Spark lab is a space to ignite curiosity, idea and innovation in young minds by converting Ideas into Reality. Spark lab encourage students to experiment with, learn, develop, conceptualize different scientific ideas, explore alternatives and create options that did not exists before. Spark lab facilitates projects similar to Do-It-Yourself projects where the students are stimulated to apply the knowledge they have gained in the classroom.</p>
                <p>The main idea behind setting up of Spark lab is to encourage the young students to understand STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) concepts practically and creatively using the specific tools and equipment. The Spark lab would contain the equipment related to robotics, electronics, science, 3D printers, sensors, etc. The approach is aimed at eliminating the limitations caused by monotonous classroom learning and using only textbooks as a reference without any exposure to a practical approach.</p>

                <p>Who knew learning could be so much fun? Akshai Summer Education Programme (ASEP) will foster individuals a connection to technology, outdoors and environment that lasts a lifetime! That creates memories while they learn. Students spent most of their days outside on our multiple playgrounds as well as across the entire campus, engaged in idea labs, outdoor exploration, gardening, and using nature as our classroom. Each week will feature a different theme to add to the fun, and we will have special guest appearances throughout the program.</p>

                <p>Play is how individuals learn best, and play is what is encouraged. There is no prior experience necessary to join our education programme camps. We welcome all skill levels. No equipment or uniforms are required for these classes during the summer camps. ASEP inspires: Confidence, Curiosity, Creativity, Experiences, Hobbies and Socialization.</p>
