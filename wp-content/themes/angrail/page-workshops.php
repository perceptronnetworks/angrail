    <p>We conduct workshops for students, faculty members, researchers and industry professionals. Our workshop model is unique, and it always has inter-disciplinary department students' involvement. For example, in our IoT workshop, students from Computer Science, Electronics & Communications and any other core engineering & science group students can participate. Theory concepts and the complimenting hands-on exercise will feed your mind and organs to remember the core concepts of the particular topic. At the end of every section, the participants will give a gamified quiz/assignment during the workshop. Finally, a real-world capstone project will be given to the participants to test the outcome of the workshop.</p>
