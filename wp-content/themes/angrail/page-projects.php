        <p>Students always wonder where to apply the skills and concepts they learn during their classes. Project work is one of the exciting places to apply the skills. Project work starts from childhood, even before school. One can remember our parents give a physical activity with toys for the kids. It also strengthens the cognitive thinking ability of the kid. Any individual will always enjoy some physical activity while learning. </p>

        <p>We understand the significance of the projects and envisioned creating a global hub for any school and college project needs. Our project methodology is unique. Every student will have a mentor to monitor and guide the student. The mentor will help the students to find the problem statement, aim, methodology, expected outcomes and timeline. Our internet platform will allow the students and mentors to connect online and manage the whole project work online. We also have an offline mode. Students and mentors can meet and perform the projects in our centres. </p>

          <h6 class="heading">PhD Research Laboratory Services</h6>
          <p>The journey of a PhD for any individual is always challenging and complex. According to WILEY, nearly 40-50% of PhD candidates need tremendous support to complete their degrees. There requires a great effort to eliminate the high attrition in the field of PhD. We believe PhD is a prestigious academic achievement for any individual. We want to hand-hold the candidates throughout their PhD journey. However, we want to ensure the candidate attains the highest philosophical knowledge on their selected topic. We support all the courses across all domains in Engineering, Science, Arts, Management, Education, Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Medical and Allied Health Sciences.</p>

          <p>We offer support for identifying the trending topic, setting up the outcomes, guidance and support for proposal preparation, advice and support for PPT preparation, time to time IT and DTP support during PhD, etc. Our end to end Research Laboratory Services allows the candidate to utilize our extended Virtual and Remote labs for the research experiments. The candidate shall split out their work and make it available for our mentors, interns and the learning community. Our mentors will understand the candidates work and share the work with the interns and learning community. Interns shall be first, second or third year UG students, and our learning community will have a versatile set of students. These young kids will pursue the shared problem under the mentor's guidance and share the findings with the PhD candidate.</p>

          <p>Our online platform manages all the aspects of the PhD work comprehensively. PhD candidates shall discuss with the mentors and interns, and there can be a cross-learning.</p>
