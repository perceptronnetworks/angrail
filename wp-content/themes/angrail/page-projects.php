      <p>Students always wonder where to apply the skills and concepts they learn during their classes. Project work is one of the exciting places to apply the skills. Project work starts from childhood, even before school. One can remember our parents give a physical activity with toys for the kids. It also strengthens the cognitive thinking ability of the kid. Any individual will always enjoy some physical activity while learning. </p>

      <p>We understand the significance of the projects and envisioned creating a global hub for any school and college project needs. Our project methodology is unique. Every student will have a mentor to monitor and guide the student. The mentor will help the students to find the problem statement, aim, methodology, expected outcomes and timeline. Our internet platform will allow the students and mentors to connect online and manage the whole project work online. We also have an offline mode. Students and mentors can meet and perform the projects in our centres. </p>

      <p>We support the students with hardware & software needs, research laboratory needs and publishing journals and articles. Our state of the art Special Research Lab access will give a comprehensive lab facility to the students. Students can learn the skill needed to complete the project using our course platform. We also have an internship platform where a novice with basic knowledge will be eager to participate in projects. These interns shall assign to the project students to perform some portion of the project. Project guidance and support are applicable for school and college students. </p>
